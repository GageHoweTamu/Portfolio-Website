            One pertinent example of leadership and problem solving is my "masks for poverty" project, which I completed in June of 2021. The original problem statement was that my hometown of Sugar Land, TX had many people in poverty who couldn't get access to reusable, quality face masks, so I planned to create as many as possible within my deadline. The barrier I encountered was that I couldn't work in-person with the volunteers due to Covid-19. The way I addressed this was to assign specific jobs to each volunteer and hold weekly Zoom meetings. I also planned time to sanitize the 840 masks before delivery to the poverty center. The process felt stilted and clunky due to the remote communication, but I enjoyed the outcome and the satisfaction of knowing I made a solid difference.

            I think my project Hyper Lethal that I led for the Aggie Coding Club stands out as an "extra mile" achievement. It isn't very complicated; I wanted to create a top-down spaceship game, like Asteroids but more full-featured. After having the project approved from the Aggie Coding Club, I created a Discord server, gave our 10 project members direction as best as possible. I provided links to existing project documentation, reached out to members to see if they felt unincluded or overwhelmed, and encouraged those who made great progress. This ultimately led to my being awarded the Aggie Coding Club's Best Project Manager award.

            I am an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. I have served as the Senior Patrol Leader of my BSA troop of ~30 people for 6 months.
            During this time, I led a project with ~20 volunteers to create ~840 woven fabric masks and distribute them to the local Attack Poverty organization.
            I also led a project for the Aggie Coding Club and received Best Project Manager for Fall 2023.
            I'm currently in a research role for developing algorithms for magnet tracking with 6 degrees of freedom via a sensor array.</p>
