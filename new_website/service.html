                    <p>I'm Gage, a software developer and student at Texas A&M University. I'm firmly convinced that Rust is the future of systems programming and many more fields. I'm currently seeking internships, especially those involving databases, backend engineering, and embedded systems for summer 2025. I'm also interested in open source projects, so feel free to reach out if you have a project that could use some help!</p>
